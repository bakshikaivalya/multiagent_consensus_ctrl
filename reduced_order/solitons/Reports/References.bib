    abstract = {{This book presents a comprehensive development of effective numerical methods for stochastic control problems in continuous time. The process models are diffusions, jump-diffusions, or reflected diffusions of the type that occur in the majority of current applications. All the usual problem formulations are included, as well as those of more recent interest such as ergodic control, singular control and the types of reflected diffusions used as models of queuing networks. Applications to complex deterministic problems are illustrated via application to a large class of problems from the calculus of variations. The general approach is known as the Markov Chain Approximation Method. The required background to stochastic processes is surveyed, there is an extensive development of methods of approximation, and a chapter is devoted to computational techniques. The book is written on two levels, that of practice (algorithms and applications) and that of the mathematical development. Thus the methods and use should be broadly accessible. This update to the first edition will include added material on the control of the 'jump term' and the 'diffusion term.' There will be additional material on the deterministic problems, solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equations, for which the authors' methods are still among the most useful for many classes of problems. All of these topics are of great and growing current interest.}},

    abstract = {{How do single nerve cells multiply, integrate or delay synaptic inputs? What is the repertoire of computational operations available to individual nerve cells? How accurately can information be encoded in the voltage across the membrane, in the intracellular calcium concentration or in the timing of individual spikes? "Biophysics of Computation: Information Processing in Single Neurons" focuses on these questions at the interface between cellular biophysics and computational theory. Neural network research builds on the fiction that neurons are simple linear threshold units, completely neglecting the highly dynamic and complex nature of synapses, dendrites and voltage-dependent ionic currents. This textbook rectifies this situation. <P>Key topics are the linear cable equation, passive dendritic trees and dendritic spines, chemical and electrical synapses and how to treat them from a computational point of view, nonlinear interactions in passive and active dendritic trees, the Hodgkin-Huxley model of action potential generation and propagation, phase space analysis, linking stochastic ionic channels to membrane dependent currents, calcium- and potassium-currents and their role in information processing, the role of diffusion, buffering and binding of calcium and other messenger systems in information processing and storage, short- and long-term models of synaptic plasticity, simplified models of single cells, stochastic aspects of neuronal firing, the nature of the neuronal code and unconventional models of computation involving molecules, puffs of gas or neuropeptides. <P>Each chapter ends with a recapitulation of the material presented. The ultimate chapter provides a summary view of neuron-style computation, ending with a list of strategic questions for research. The text speaks to undergraduate and graduate students and beyond in the neuroscience, electrical and computer engineering and physics communities.}},

	@article{Todorov2002,
  abstract = {A central problem in motor control is understanding how the many biomechanical
	degrees of freedom are coordinated to achieve a common goal. An especially
	puzzling aspect of coordination is that behavioral goals are achieved
	reliably and repeatedly with movements rarely reproducible in their
	detail. Existing theoretical frameworks emphasize either goal achievement
	or the richness of motor variability, but fail to reconcile the two.
	Here we propose an alternative theory based on stochastic optimal
	feedback control. We show that the optimal strategy in the face of
	uncertainty is to allow variability in redundant (task-irrelevant)
	dimensions. This strategy does not enforce a desired trajectory,
	but uses feedback more intelligently, correcting only those deviations
	that interfere with task goals. From this framework, task-constrained
	variability, goal-directed corrections, motor synergies, controlled
	parameters, simplifying rules and discrete coordination modes emerge
	naturally. We present experimental results from a range of motor
	tasks to support this theory.},

Maximum-likelihood estimation of a mixed jump-diffusion process reveals that exchange rates exhibit systematic discontinuities, even after allowing for conditional heteroskedasticity in the diffusion process. The results are much more significant in the foreign exchange market than in the stock market, which suggests differences in the structure of these markets. Finally, this jump component is shown to explain some of the empirically observed mispricings in the currency options market.},

@article{Todorov:2004,
  abstract = {The sensorimotor system is a product of evolution, development, learning
	and adaptation—which work on different time scales to improve behavioral
	performance. Consequently, many theories of motor function are based
	on ‘optimal performance’: they quantify task goals as cost functions,
	and apply the sophisticated tools of optimal control theory to obtain
	detailed behavioral predictions. The resulting models, although not
	without limitations, have explained more empirical phenomena than
	any other class. Traditional emphasis has been on optimizing desired
	movement trajectories while ignoring sensory feedback. Recent work
	has redefined optimality in terms of feedback control laws, and focused
	on the mechanisms that generate behavior online. This approach has
	allowed researchers to fit previously unrelated concepts and observations
	into what may become a unified theoretical framework for interpreting
	motor function. At the heart of the framework is the relationship
	between high-level goals, and the real-time sensorimotor control
	strategies most suitable for accomplishing those goals.},

@article{Todorov:2004,
abstract = {The sensorimotor system is a product of evolution, development, learning
and adaptation—which work on different time scales to improve behavioral
performance. Consequently, many theories of motor function are based
on ‘optimal performance’: they quantify task goals as cost functions,
and apply the sophisticated tools of optimal control theory to obtain
detailed behavioral predictions. The resulting models, although not
without limitations, have explained more empirical phenomena than
any other class. Traditional emphasis has been on optimizing desired
movement trajectories while ignoring sensory feedback. Recent work
has redefined optimality in terms of feedback control laws, and focused
on the mechanisms that generate behavior online. This approach has
allowed researchers to fit previously unrelated concepts and observations
into what may become a unified theoretical framework for interpreting
motor function. At the heart of the framework is the relationship
between high-level goals, and the real-time sensorimotor control
strategies most suitable for accomplishing those goals.},

abstract="We survey here some recent studies concerning what we call mean-field models by analogy with Statistical Mechanics and Physics. More precisely, we present three examples of our mean-field approach to modelling in Economics and Finance (or other related subjects...). Roughly speaking, we are concerned with situations that involve a very large number of ``rational players'' with a limited information (or visibility) on the ``game''. Each player chooses his optimal strategy in view of the global (or macroscopic) informations that are available to him and that result from the actions of all players. In the three examples we mention here, we derive a mean-field problem which consists in nonlinear differential equations. These equations are of a new type and our main goal here is to study them and establish their links with various fields of Analysis. We show in particular that these nonlinear problems are essentially well-posed problems i.e., have unique solutions. In addition, we give various limiting cases, examples and possible extensions. And we mention many open problems.",
